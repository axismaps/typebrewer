			<h1>TypeBrewer is temporarily offline</h1>
			<p id="intro">TypeBrewer has been a Flash-based application for over 10 years and the time has come for a much needed update. (Plus, a recent Flash Player update seems to have permanently broken it!) Thanks for your patience while a new HTML-based TypeBrewer is built. Expect to see the same good cartographic design principles and practices in a much more modernized system coming soon.</p>

			<h2>About TypeBrewer</h2>
			<p>TypeBrewer is a free help tool that allows non-specialist mapmakers to explore typography in a semi-structured environment. It is not mapmaking software. Instead of providing all the functionality of a graphic design program or GIS, TypeBrewer strips type selection down to its basic elements: font family, text size, letter spacing, and label density (i.e., tracking). It offers a quick and easy way to explore typographic alternatives and see the impact they have on the overall "look and feel" of a map. TypeBrewer is designed for mapmakers who want to learn more about map typography and get text specifications for starting a map project.</p>
			<p>At the core of TypeBrewer are twelve typographic "palettes". These are combinations of font families that vary in text size, letter spacing, and label density. They can be applied to a wide range of possible projects to help achieve important map design goals, such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Legibility</b> of map text under normal screen and print reading conditions.</li>
					<li><b>Functionality</b> of map text to communicate a good visual hierarchy of map features.</li>
					<li><b>Visual appeal</b> of map text through the intelligent combination of font families and styles.</li>
				</ul>
